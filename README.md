This is for my expenses analysis project where I look at my expense data for meaningful insights.

**Expense_Analysis.ipynb**
---
This notebook has the analysis of my spending. The data for this notebook is made from my personal expenses using Expense Manager app. I recorded almost all my expense transactions to manage my finances and also for this project. I used the entire data for analysis but since the data has personal information about my finances, I am reducing the no of observations to 500 in the csv file uploaded here.

**Motivation**
---
I made this notebook to get a better understanding of python for Data Science. I was auditing the course "Introduction to Data Science in Python" and I wanted to test the skills that i learnt in the course. Since I was already tracking my expenses, I started this project with learning as the main goal.
